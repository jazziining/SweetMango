  <h2>Waxing vs Sugaring</h2>
  <p>Hair removal is a major concern for many people. Some of the most popular forms of hair removal include shaving, waxing, tweezing, sugaring and electrolysis. We compare waxing to sugaring to see which one is best for you.


The simplest and most effective way to explain and compare the difference for people who have never been Waxed or Sugared before, or have only been waxed and want to know the benefits of sugaring.

First and foremost wax whether it is hot or cold is full of chemicals and harmful for all skin types. It is very hot when it is applied creating a sticker effect and adhering to the skin, when it is removed it also takes off layers of healthy skin with it. Also often resulting in burns, scars and tender skin for hours sometimes days. This can also be a reason why people break out in bumps and irritation. Estheticians who wax use spatulas can never properly gage the temperature of the wax before it goes on the skin. Sugaring is made up of sugar cane, lemon and water. Three simple ingredients you can literally eat. If you get it in you hair, on the floor or anywhere it shouldn't be, it dissolves with water. (can not do that with wax) Sugar is also not hot when it goes on so it only ever take the hair never the skin with it.

Next, Wax is also extremely unsanitary, most places that use wax are notorious for cross contamination. The wax pots do not get changed as often as they should and they are burning hot with bacteria like other peoples hair follicles, dead skin cells and blood particles sitting at the bottom. This is another reason why people break out in bumps and irritation that they don't know is actually bacterial.

Sugaring is applied with gloves and is NEVER double dipped in the same pot. Once the paste has been used and finished it is discarded a new glove and new paste is started. It only ever touches the person being sugared at the time.

Finally, The major difference between Waxing and Sugaring is the application.

Waxing is smoothed on with the hair growth and seal down (hot sticker effect) and ripped in the opposite direction. Similar to the approach of shaving you are going against the grain and just cutting it off the top. Wax can only remove about 80/85% of hair the rest gets broken off into the skin leaving nasty red inflamed ingrown hairs.

Sugaring is the complete opposite. The paste is rolled on in the opposite direction of the hair growth (think about petting a cat backwards) and flicked off in the same direction as the hair growth. Similar to how women are taught to tweezer their eye brows, going with the hair. The hair comes back so much thinner, finer, softer, much less and significantly decreases ingrown hairs.
