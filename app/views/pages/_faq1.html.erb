<h2>Laser Hair Removal</h2>
<p>Cosmetic disaster: Paula Azevedo hides her arms. The glossy magazine adverts promised an easy, non-surgical solution to unwanted hair and fine lines. For Paula Azevedo, they offered an alternative to waxing or shaving. "I'm a perfectionist over my appearance and the dark hair on my arms was starting to bother me," says Paula, a 38-year-old investment banker from London. "I wanted to feel confident in summer clothes."

Lured by the ads, as well as a recommendation from a friend, she visited a central London clinic last July and paid £700 for a course of laser hair removal on her arms. But instead of hairless, flawless skin, Paula was left with second-degree burns, blisters and excruciating pain. She may be permanently scarred. "Lasers can be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands," says David Gault, a consultant plastic surgeon and laser expert at the Cadogan Clinic in London."If used on the wrong type of skin, they can cause serious burns and lasting pigment damage. They can also damage the eyes and cause blindness. The problem is that the adverts trivialize these treatments and promise permanent hair removal. In most cases it won't be permanent, but this is rarely made clear to patients."

Lasers were first used in the sixties to treat ingrown eyelashes and to remove hair before surgical operations, but the procedure took off in the mid-nineties with the invention of the nd-YAG, a laser still used for hair removal. There are 20 types of laser treatment in Britain, including Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) and Alexandrite.All work similarly: a light source targets the melanin (dark pigment) in a hair follicle, which destroys and weakens the hair's growth. It feels hot on the skin, so a cooling gel is applied to the surrounding skin to protect it from injury. The treatment can also be used to "resurface" the skin - heat damage is caused to the skin to help it shed layer by layer, targeting wrinkles and scarring.

LASER therapy has become increasingly popular, with 166,000 cosmetic treatments in 2005 alone. Clinics offering laser treatment are regulated by the Healthcare Commission, which ensures they stick to safety guidelines (such as the wearing of goggles by the practitioner and client). But last month the Government announced plans to abolish the need for regulation. This would mean people without any training or qualification could offer laser cosmetic treatments.Experts believe there are 4,000 unlicensed laser hair removal providers in Britain and only 850 clinics licensed and regulated by the Healthcare Commission.The British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons(BAAPS) has reacted vehemently to the proposals, arguing that cases such as Paula's indicate that the industry needs tougher, not less, regulation."It's absurd that politicians, who know little about the complications for such treatments, should seek to further deregulate," said Douglas McGeorge, BAAPS president and a consultant plastic surgeon."It's like leaving the fox in charge of the henhouse."

In fact, the clinic where Paula was treated is regulated by the Healthcare Commission. Her treatment was handled properly at first. She had a consultation and patch test (when the laser was used on a small area of skin to test if she reacted badly). But Paula was not warned about the risk of burning or scarring - and when the therapist began the treatment on her left arm, the pain was excruciating. "It was like having an iron applied to my skin relentlessly," she says."I didn't think it was right and asked the therapist to stop a couple of times, but she just kept going."As the therapist began to treat Paula's right arm, her left arm began to blister. But it wasn't until she was halfway through treating Paula's right arm that the therapist reluctantly agreed to try a gentler laser. After the treatment finished, Paula's left arm was covered in swollen, burning purple rings."When I complained to the clinic, they simply gave me some aloe vera cream and sent me home. The next morning, the pain and swelling was so bad I went to A&E."

A plastic surgeon she saw was "shocked" by the state of her skin. The burns were cleaned and bandaged, and she was advised to get a tetanus shot. As well as the physical scarring, Paula has since suffered depression and anxiety. "I'd spent all this money to look more attractive, and instead I feared I'd look like a freak for the rest of my life. I couldn't cover up my arms all the time, so it felt as if I was constantly dodging people's stares. I've been left with dark circles all over my arms and they darken dramatically if I go in the sun."The clinic never apologized."They even tried to charge me £200 in cancellation fees when I refused to have further treatments," says Paula. She was offered a refund of just £147 from the £714 she originally paid. "But to give me even that paltry sum, they wanted me to sign a form saying I wouldn't take legal action against the clinic or speak to a third party about my experience. I refused."

Paula is now taking legal action against the clinic. A spokesman for the Department of Health said people having hair removal do so at their own risk. For Sinem Morgan, 27, a software manager from London, talk of risk is too late. She visited an Essex laser clinic in January for IPL hair removal on her thighs and back. Sinem was told nothing of the risks and was treated by a beautician who, she later discovered, had no medical training. "Despite the excruciating pain, I assumed they knew what they were doing," she says. Instead, she was left with second and third-degree burns on her thighs, groin and back. "I couldn't get into my jeans and the clinic manager had to take me to the supermarket to buy burn cream to relieve my pain.They claimed I had an allergy to heat or light. If this was true, wouldn't I have known it by the time I'd reached 27?"

IPL should not be used on olive or tanned skin such as Sinem's, according to Professor Nick Lowe, a consultant dermatologist at London's Cranley Clinic. "The IPL laser looks for the dark melanin or pigment in hair in order to destroy it. If the skin is olive or tanned, the laser can mistake the pigment in the skin for the hair and destroy that, too. The result can be permanent blotching that gets worse every time you go in the sun." Consultant plastic surgeon Mr McGeorge adds: "Without checks and balances anyone can open a clinic and perform dangerous treatments. There could be many more cases like Sinem's and Paula's."

The painful truth about hair removal is that it can be:


COSTLY
One disadvantage of laser hair removal is the cost associated with the treatment. Unfortunately you can't get away with one treatment. You have to have a series of sessions to make it work, which can be expensive. At the end of those treatments there is no guarantee and many times hair does return.

PAINFUL
During laser hair removal a laser, or a concentrated beam of light, is aimed at the skin. It is this laser that destroys the hair follicles. The treatment has to be done up to 8 times to fully work. The beam of light or laser burns and can severely irritate the skin. Many clients have had to seek medical attention after a laser treatment. Some clients have had to have plastic surgery to fix the problem.

THE PROOF
This is a client of Sweet Mango who has had laser hair removal done in the past. She had purchased a voucher offline without doing any research on the machines used or clinic and did not have her skin patch tested first. Unfortunately suffering major consequences such as burning and permanently scaring the treated areas.Skin damage is real and very common many laser treatment locations have unqualified staff performing this procedure. If it seems too good to be true… it is. Michelle is now a happy client of SweetMango and like her TESTIMONIAL says “I highly recommend Sweet Mango and guarantee once you try it you'll never want to stop.
